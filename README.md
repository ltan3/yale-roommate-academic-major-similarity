A social network visualization and analysis of Yale University undergraduate student directory data, showing (p&lt;.01) that students who are roommates tend to be majoring in similar diciplines. I show, for example, that engineering students tend to live with other engineering students, or with mathematics or physical science students, and tend not to live with history or philosophy students.

Figure: Visualization of declared majors and roommate relationships in the class of 2021. Each circle is a major at Yale, and bigger circles represent more popular majors. A thicker line between two circles means students in those two majors more frequently room together.
